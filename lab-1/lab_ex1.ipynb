Chest X-rays are typically performed on patients to check for pneumonia, and doctors will then examine the X-ray images and conclude accordingly.\n","\n","Our objective for this lab exercise is to use machine learning techniques such as kNN and SVM to classify X-ray image as either ‘normal’ or ‘pneumonia’.\n","\n","This lab exercise will be done in a step-by-step manner, following the typical machine learning pipeline. Some parts of the code will be pre-written for you, and some parts will require you to write your own code to achieve the desired outcome. All those parts that require your own code input will be commented out in green as [YOUR CODE HERE] with the specific instructions that you will need to follow."],"metadata":{"id":"B4kxcwf8IS5G"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Import Python libraries and mount Google Drive for dataset"],"metadata":{"id":"S-YSUmDWJktf"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import cv2\n","import os\n","import math\n","import numpy as np\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow"],"metadata":{"id":"Vp2F2zPnJnJu"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"3ny7siyiIOyt"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.
